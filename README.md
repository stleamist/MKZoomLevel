[![Build on Xcode (12 beta)](https://github.com/stleamist/MKZoomLevel/workflows/Build%20on%20Xcode%20(12%20beta)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stleamist/MKZoomLevel/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+on+Xcode+%2812+beta%29%22)

MKZoomLevel is an implementation of zoom level getter & setter for MKMapView that works exactly the same as the private `_zoomLevel` property without resetting the camera angle.

## Features
- It returns exactly the same value as the internal `_zoomLevel` value as well as when the orientation or the angle is changed, which is in the `MKMapView`â€™s private API.
- It preserves the value of `heading` and `pitch` of the `camera` property for a new zoom level as they are, rather than resetting the camera angle.
- It returns the latest zoom level even when the animation of region change is not finished, in contrast with the `camera` property.

## Usage
```swift
import MapKit
import MKZoomLevel

let mapView = MKMapView()

// Get the zoom level
mapView.zoomLevel

// Set the zoom level
mapView.zoomLevel = 16.0

// Set the zoom level with an animation
mapView.setZoomLevel(16.0, animated: true)
```
